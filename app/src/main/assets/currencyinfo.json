This process guarantees the network and gradually generates new coins over time without consuming significant computational power.

Maker allows users to leverage their Ethereum assets to generate Dai on the Maker System. Once created, users can employ Dai in the same way as any other virtual currency: it can be freely transferred to others, manipulated as payments for goods and services, or held as long-term savings.

BlakeStar is one of the first cryptocurrencies to use the Blake2s hashing algorithm. Blake2s itself is a high speed optimized cryptographic hashing algorithm used for Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake hashes in BlakeStar for performance with low load. BlakeStar uses Proof-of-Work, but unlike Bitcoin, it is configured to transition to Proof-of-Stake, when small numbers of coins are issued yearly for staking. Staking will be 10% per year. The advantage of transitioning to Proof-of-Stake is to avoid the centralized mining pools that may eventually threaten Bitcoin with a 51% attack. Most Bitcoin mining has been centralized in China, which is not necessarily a good thing for the currency. Proof-of-Stake is known to discourage centralized mining pools. This makes BlakeStar ideally suited for dedicated staking devices and low-power/low-spec systems. Originally dependent on the \"libb2\" library version of the Blake2s reference distribution, the blake2s reference implementation has now been directly baked in for ease of compilation across platforms. Users no longer need to download and install libb2 separately.","web":"http://www.eranetwork.net/","twt":"blakestarcoin"}},{"currencyName":"good","info":{"desc":"Live GoodCoin prices from all markets and GOOD coin market Capitalization.

Ethbet can offer bets without a house edge because players bet directly against other players instead of against a centralized house. The disadvantage of this is that in order to place a bet, there must be another party willing to place the same bet. For this reason, it is possible that a player must wait for their desired bet to take place, especially if it is tremendous. An additional feature of an optional player-defined house edge is added, allowing players to offer and take (‘call’) bets with any house edge that they desire. Thus, a player that prioritizes speed over their expected return can agree to a bet that gives him a slight disadvantage (i.e. a bet that gives his opponent a small house edge). Similarly, a player that is patient and prioritizes their expected return can offer bets that the formerly mentioned player may choose to call. This results in a model where players are effectively able to become their own casinos, allowing market forces to provide players with bets as quickly as possible at the best possible rates. The Ethbet protocol features an efficient off-chain matchmaking relay in order to allow players to quickly and cheaply communicate their intent. The protocol can also be extended to support betting using any Ethereum-based (ERC20) token and for use with other games.","web":"https://ethbet.io/","twt":"ethbetproject"}},{"currencyName":"r","info":{"desc":"Revain (Symbol: R) is an impartial analysis system developed on blockchain network technology.

It will host and execute programs popularly referred to as “smart contracts.” It will be trustworthy, scalable, concurrent, with proof-of-stake consensus and content delivery. Using smart contracts, a broad array of fully-scalable decentralized applications (dApps) can be built on the top of this platform. DApps may address areas such as identity, tokens, timestamping, financial services, monetized content delivery, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), exchanges, reputation, private social networks, marketplaces, and many more. The RChain Network implements direct node-to-node communication where each node runs the RChain platform and a set of dApps on the top of it. The heart of an RChain is the Rho Virtual Machine (RhoVM) Execution Environment, which runs multiple RhoVMs that are each executing a smart contract. These execute concurrently are multi-threaded. This concurrency which is designed around on the formal models of mobile process calculi, along with an application of compositional namespaces, allows for what are in effect multiple blockchains per node. This multi-chain, independently executing virtual machine instances is in sharp contrast to a “global compute” design which constrains transactions to be executed sequentially, on a single virtual machine. Also, each node can be configured to subscribe to and process the namespaces (blockchains) in which it is interested. Like other blockchains, achieving consensus across nodes on the state of the blockchain is essential. RChain’s protocol for replication and consensus is called Casper and is a proof-of-stake protocol. Similar to Ethereum, a contract starts out in one state, many nodes receive a signed transaction, and then their RhoVM instances execute that contract to its next state. An array of node operators, or “bonded validators” apply the consensus algorithm to crypto-economically verify that the entire history of state configurations and state transitions, of the RhoVM instance, are accurately replicated in a distributed data store. The blockchain contracts (aka smart contracts, processes, or programs), including system contracts included in the installation, are written in the RChain general-purpose language “Rholang” (Reflective higher-order language). Derived from the rho-calculus computational formalism, Rholang supports internal programmatic concurrency. It formally expresses the communication and coordination of many processes executing in parallel composition. Rholang naturally accommodates industry trends in code mobility, reactive/monadic API’s, parallelism, asynchronicity, and behavioral types.","web":"https://www.rchain.coop/","twt":"rchain_coop"}},{"currencyName":"arc*","info":{"desc":"Live ArcticCoin prices from all markets and ARC coin market Capitalization.

The deliberate, fair, launch strategy allows participants the opportunity to join a promising project at inception. The team offers a simple value proposition with no grandiose promise: they will deliver a privacy coin that works today and into the future by leveraging best-practices from both DASH and PIVX. No fanciful visions with a limited prospect of delivery, but a working coin on a working platform with support into the future. This doesn\u0027t mean that the team plans no innovation, but instead that they will deliver results rather than hype. There are too many coins that are fueled by hype - but completely devoid of substance - and they do not want to join the growing cadre of coins driven by the motto of overpromising and under deliver. With no ICO, a soft-launch reward ramp, small premine, and miner-favored block reward allocations, Bulwark adopters will have ground-floor access to a privacy coin offering a blend of masternodes and the best available privacy coin technology alongside a meaningful development roadmap. Masternodes will be available, and functioning, on launch and are a primary part of this coin’s vision and will stabilize circulation, secure the network, and provide important functionality.\n","web":"https://bulwarkcrypto.com/","twt":"bulwarkcoin"}},{"currencyName":"xmrg","info":{"desc":"Live Monero Gold prices from all markets and XRG coin market Capitalization.

Genstake aims to firmly put the future of the coin in strong hands while attempting always to leave the door open for anyone to get involved with the coin through traditional means. Who can compete with POW when the monsterous hash is being thrown at a coin? There\u0027s almost no way into a valued pure POW coin these days without spending a serious amount of money on hardware. And for POW/POS coins, so much hash goes into the POW phase that the only way to get in is to get lucky right at the beginning before the difficulty grows too large. With Genstake, hopefully, once the initial dust settles it will become a coin that is accessible to everyone, and because of its inherent value to stake-mine itself it will be mostly kept off of the market and held by strong hands that will support the network indefinitely. Coins that do find their way onto the market will only give others more staking power on the network and enable others the opportunity to generate more coins for themselves.","web":"http://www.g3n.info/","twt":"genstake"}},{"currencyName":"bsx","info":{"desc":"Live Bitspace prices from all markets and BSX coin market Capitalization.
